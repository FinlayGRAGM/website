## The Golden Rule  
When unsure about implementation details, ALWAYS ask the developer.

## Code Style and Patterns  

## Functional and object oriented approach

Focus on creating functions, components, etc that the developer can use and re-use easily as opposed to coding a full structure at once.

## General
- This project uses Nuxt 3 and TailwindCSS v4 with DaisyUI. Ask before changing configuration for these
- Reusable components are a must, both through vue components as well as reusable CSS classes in assets/css.
- Use bun as the package manager
