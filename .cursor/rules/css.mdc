## Theming and CSS rules:

- assets/css/theme.css includes theme colors to use via tailwind + general CSS whenever building something
- assets/css/components.css contains reusable tidbits of CSS. Create and maintain these when building something. For any element that would contain more than 5 tailwind classes create something reusabel in assets/css/components.css. Think about how to reuse existing css classes

[theme.css](mdc:assets/css/theme.css) [components.css](mdc:assets/css/components.css) [base.css](mdc:assets/css/base.css)
