# Editing Content in This Project

All content that you can edit is stored in the `content` folder. This is tracked with git, so you can edit it using the git online editor, or contact me if you want to be able to edit it in some other editor that's more convenient.

## options.md

Almost all short pieces of text are stored in `options.md`. This includes things like the homepage text, the teaching page text, the about page text, your name, email, etc. Below is the format used:

```md
# Lines starting with "#" are ignored.

# Option name and value in this format:

# Format as [key]: [value]

# Do not alter the key, only the value. Otherwise things may break.

homepage.recentAndUpcoming.title: Recent & Upcoming

# For things that are lists, use the following format:

# Start at 1 and increment for each item. Follow the existing format. in options.md

homepage.recentAndUpcoming.upcomingWorks.1.title: Symphony No. 2
homepage.recentAndUpcoming.upcomingWorks.1.description: A large-scale orchestral work exploring themes of memory and time
homepage.recentAndUpcoming.upcomingWorks.1.status: In Progress
homepage.recentAndUpcoming.upcomingWorks.1.expectedDate: Spring 2024
```

## Colors:

To edit colors edit colors.md. When editing make sure to only edit within the code fences ("\`\`\`") and not outside of them. Currently colors are in the oklch format which is best overall, but it should support any color format. Use a color picker like [this](https://oklch.com/) to pick some colors.

Again don't edit the key, only the values.

## Images:

Images are stored in `content/media`. To add an image:

1. Create a new folder in `content/media` with the name of the image, e.g. `content/media/my-image`.
2. Add the image to the folder as `photo.jpg/jpeg/png/etc`.
3. Create `index.yaml` in the folder with the following format:

```yaml
title: Title of the image
description: Description
image: photo.jpeg (path to the image)
```

_Note: Don't worry about other fields like metadata or blurhash, they are autogenerated._

## Writings:
Writings are stored in `content/writing`. Each piece of writing here should look like this:

```md
---
title: Nothing Gold Can Stay
description: This is a test poem description
date: 2025-01-01
---

<!-- Actual content here -->
Nature’s first green is gold,
Her hardest hue to hold.
Her early leaf’s a flower;
But only so an hour.
Then leaf subsides to leaf.
So Eden sank to grief,
So dawn goes down to day.
Nothing gold can stay.
```

## Musical Compositions:
Musical compositions are stored in `content/pieces`. They have a bit more metadata, but the format is similar:

```md
---

## Making files accessible to the site

Files that are accessible to the site are stored in `public`. Navigate to the `public` folder and upload/delete files here. Don't mess with things that are in folders like `media` or `pieces` as they are auto copied to fix a bug.
