What I Hope You Heard, Regardless is a piece about losing memories. It’s about
the feeling of recollection which is both painful and joyful and neither. It
explores ideas of presence, patience, love, and loss, and is the composer’s
attempt at reclaiming a style of gentle, thoughtful music for themself.
