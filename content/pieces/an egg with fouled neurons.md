The egg lacks organs and cellular structure, but it could be alive. When vibrated, it notices each simplified frequency. If you apply equal pressure to all sides, it doesn't break, but moments of concentration are dangerous. If permeated and submerged, it's unclear where the egg begins, and what is inside.

_1. the breath_
Is it dirtier to have air within or without the lungs

_2. initiation (subconscious)_
_**Bereitschaftspotential**_ (also called pre-motor potential) - a negative electrical potential that starts building in the brain well before a person is consciously aware of deciding to make a movement. Associated with movement initiation.

_3. embodiment/mirroring_
_**Mirror Neurons**_ - how aware are you?

_4. silence_
The effort required to not make sound.

_5. onset_

_6. liberation_
the ooey-gooey thawing of the core

_7. oneness and death_
an egg outside of its shell tends to rot in the shape of fractals.

_8. contraction_
