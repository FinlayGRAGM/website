Blue Green Blue Sea is a piece about exploring the tide pools in coastal Washington with my sister and father. Here are the piece's main characters:

Common Acorn Barnacle (Balanus glandula)
Sea Grass (Various Species)
Aggregate Anenome (Anthopleura elegantissima)
Hairy Hermit Crab (Pagurus hirsutiusculus)
Ribbed Limpet (Lottia digitalis)
Barred Grass Shrimp (Palaeumonetes ritteri)
Harbor Seals (Phoca vitulina)

The piece also uses certain polytonal chords to represent the colors green and blue, and an underlying chorale which shows the movement of the ocean.
