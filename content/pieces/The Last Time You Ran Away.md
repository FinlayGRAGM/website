The Last Time You Ran Away is a composition based on ghosts. By feeding detected movement into individually pixelated Markov Chains, one can create “ghosts” of motion which follow unseen patterns before dissipating into pixelated noise. These ghosts are neither alive nor dead, occupying a state of undeath wherein they move in creative mimicry, but are dictated wholly by conceptual rules. From order comes movement by unwritten rules, which in turn becomes unordered noise, still made of rules and imperceptibly clean.

>Premiered at Oberlin Conservatory Melded Sounds 2025.
