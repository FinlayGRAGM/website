One skill that we often have to practice in order to benefit from the internet is the ability to quickly sort and block information as facing such an available mass of information without a filter can be destructive. In writing this piece, I wanted to focus on the world that I observe when I decide to not filter the information that I receive, instead adopting a more ironic understanding, which focuses not on scientific truth, but more on association.

When I do this, I am presented with a world that feels full of contradictions. It first feels overwhelmingly wide, then distressingly narrow. It feels full of both potential and lethargy. It's varying degrees of comforting and toxic such that it becomes impossible to distinguish which is which. Mostly, it is entertaining--at the risk that the world feels less vibrant.

To me it feels both alien and human. It's a system that is driven first by human input and psychology, but is dictated by an algorithm with a fiscal responsibility to "waste" time--which is designed firstly and lastly to preserve and propagate itself, at the risk of growing increasingly exaggerated and distorted on the way.

Fantasy Life is about the interaction between human input and algorithmic distortion. It's hundreds of voices bound together reaching a twisted unison that determines not just how we spend our time, but how we think and see.
