THe egg lacks organs and cellular structure, but it could be alive. When vibrated, it notices each simplified frequency. If you apply equal pressure to all sides, it doesn't break, but moments of concentration are dangerous. If permeated and submerged, it's unclear where the egg begins, and what is inside.

> 1. the breath
Is it dirtier to have air within or without the lungs

> 2. initiation (subconscious)
_**Bereitschaftspotential**_ (also called pre-motor potential) - a negative electrical potential that starts building in the brain well before a person is consciously aware of deciding to make a movement. Associated with movement initiation.

> 4. embodiment/mirroring
_**Mirror Neurons**_ - how aware are you?

> 5. onset

>6. liberation
the ooey-gooey thawing of the core

>7. oneness and death
an egg outside of its shell tends to rot in the shape of fractals.

>8. contraction
