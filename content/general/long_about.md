Finlay Grimsley Graham (b. 2005, he/him), is a composer from Asheville, North Carolina whose work is inspired by nature, spirituality, and the lived emotional experience. Coming from a diverse musical background spanning genres from the classical orchestra to pop, he has studied piano in both jazz and classical contexts, as well as classical percussion and clarinet.


Graham’s music incorporates ideas of range, rhythm, and physicality. He aims to be both visceral and relatable in his approach, emphasizing the role of music as a connective fabric between lived experiences. He has a sizable body of work for the percussion ensemble and piano, though he considers himself instrumentally versatile.


Graham is currently enrolled at Oberlin College and Conservatory studying Music Composition, Neuroscience, and Hispanic Studies with a minor in Music and Cognition. He currently studies Composition under Stephen Hartke and Michael Frazier. Graham’s interests outside of music include running, poetry, teaching, whitewater kayaking, and backpacking.
