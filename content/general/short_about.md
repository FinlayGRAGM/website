---

Hello I am Finlay. I am a composer and musician from the UK. I have been writing music for over 10 years and have a passion for creating unique and engaging soundscapes. My work spans various genres, including electronic, orchestral, and ambient music. I enjoy collaborating with other artists and exploring new musical ideas. In addition to composing, I also produce music and sound design for film, games, and other media. My goal is to create music that resonates with listeners and enhances their experiences.
