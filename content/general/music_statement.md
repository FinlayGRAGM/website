title: Compositional Philosophy
---

> Music should be both intellectually engaging and emotionally resonant, creating spaces for contemplation and wonder.

My approach to composition is rooted in the belief that music can serve as a bridge between the rational and the intuitive, the familiar and the unknown. Each piece begins with a question or an image, often drawn from the natural world or from moments of profound human experience.

I am particularly drawn to the concept of musical time as something fluid and malleable, where moments can expand or contract based on their emotional weight. This leads me to explore extended techniques, unconventional forms, and the integration of silence as an active compositional element.

The relationship between performer and audience is central to my work. I strive to create pieces that offer both technical challenges for the musicians and accessible entry points for listeners, regardless of their musical background.
